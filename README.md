# Simple twilio integration with Discord

### With this script you can call phone numbers directly from discord which allow to intercept the caller voice in a discord voice channel.
### Thanks for [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/en-us) which helped me to make this possible.

## Getting started
1. install node dependencies using `npm install`
2. create a copy of `.env.example` to `.env`
3. complete `.env` variables
4. replace the websocket stream url from `twiml.xml`
5. run `npm run start`
